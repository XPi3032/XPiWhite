I provide whitelists for the Pi-hole on this site.
***Coming Soon***
If you would like to find out how to incorporate these whitelists into your Pi-hole, also see the [Whitelist Machine](wm.pinetmedia.com).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/XPi3032/XPiWhite/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
